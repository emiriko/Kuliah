# Assignment 6 Template Directory

> Authors: RF, ACE

The whole project directory is structurized as the compnetcsui/a06 workspace. For a consistent experience, please use the entire directory as is without any file additions or removal unless you actually know what you are doing.

## Execution Directory

When executing a file, whether it is the client or the server. You will need to be in the project's root directory, which is where this documentation lives.

## Executing the Client Program

~~~bash
go run compnetcsui/a06/client
~~~

## Executing the Server Program

~~~bash
go run compnetcsui/a06/server
~~~
